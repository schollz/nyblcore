# nyblcore

nyblcore is a tiny sampler. emphasis on tiny - it has 512 bytes of memory (~30 million times less than your computer) and 8 kilobytes of storage (~120 million times less than your computer). despite I was able to integrate the nyblcore with:

- 6 beats of audio at 150 bpm
- tempo control
- volume control
- effects (noise gating, distortion, gating)
- performance (jumping, stuttering, reversing, stretching)
- clock syncing
- core swapping

## controls

### left knob

- 00 mute/volume/distortion
- 01 noise gate
- 10 probability
- 11 retrigger

## right knob

- 00 tempo
- 01 gate
- 10 ?
- 11 stutter
