# nyblcore

nyblcore is a tiny sampler. emphasis on tiny - it has 512 bytes of memory (~30 million times less than your computer) and 8 kilobytes of storage (~120 million times less than your computer). despite I was able to integrate the nyblcore with:

- 6 beats of audio at 150 bpm
- tempo control
- volume control
- effects (noise gating, distortion, gating)
- performance (jumping, stuttering, reversing, stretching)
- clock syncing
- core swapping
