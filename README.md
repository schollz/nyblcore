## what is it?

nyblcore is...

- a tiny **ATtiny85-based sample player** device for diy enthusiasts.
- powered by a single AAA for **~5-8 hours of battery life**.
- holding 8 kB of storage for up to **1.2 seconds of 8-bit audio sampled @ 4.1 kHz**.
- controlled by multi-functional knobs that modulate tempo, volume, distortion.
- probability-based. knobs also control the chaos of **jump, retrig, stutter and stretch** fx.
- able to **load custom firmware / audio** using an [Arduino](https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-A000066-ARDUINO-UNO-R3/dp/B008GRTSV6/?tag=scholl-20&th=1) or an [AVR usb programmer](https://www.amazon.com/whiteeeen-Tiny-AVR-Programmer/dp/B09921SC7Z/?tag=scholl-20&th=1) with [web-based tool](https://www.notion.so/pikocore-desktop-adf8f2e380b94334857e884fe1b85dcd).
- entirely [open-source](https://github.com/schollz/nyblcore), wonderfully hackable.

nyblcore is available for purchase. The assembled version is ready to play, handmade by me. The kit version comes with all the components (battery included!) and instructions on how to solder it together.

## support open-source

nyblcore is open-source, all the code and boards are on my github here. 

If you make this device yourself, please consider [sponsoring me on github](https://github.com/sponsors/schollz) to support my time and effort in this project and to continue to allow me to explore making devices and releasing them as open-source. 

of course, you can also support this work by [buying the device directly from me](https://nyblcore.com/#buy).
