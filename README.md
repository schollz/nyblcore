nyblcore is...

- a tiny **ATtiny85-based sample player** device for diy enthusiasts.
- powered by a single AAA for **~5-8 hours of battery life**.
- holding 8 kB of storage for up to **1.2 seconds of 8-bit audio sampled @ 4.1 kHz**.
- controlled with three multi-functional knobs that modulate tempo, volume, distortion, and fx.
- manipulated with **three fx knobs that "control" jump, retrig, stutter and stretch**.
- able to **load custom firmware / audio** using an [Arduino](https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-A000066-ARDUINO-UNO-R3/dp/B008GRTSV6/?tag=scholl-20&th=1) or an [AVR usb programmer](https://www.amazon.com/whiteeeen-Tiny-AVR-Programmer/dp/B09921SC7Z/?tag=scholl-20&th=1).
- entirely open-source, wonderfully hackable.

nyblcore is available for purchase. The assembled version is ready to play, handmade by me. The kit version comes with all the components (battery included!) and instructions on how to solder it together.
